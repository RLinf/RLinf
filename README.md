<h1 align="center">RLinf: Reinforcement Learning Infrastructure for Agentic AI</h1>

RLinf is a flexible and scalable open-source infrastructure designed for post-training foundation models via reinforcement learning. The 'inf' in RLinf stands for Infrastructure, highlighting its role as a robust backbone for next-generation training. It also stands for Infinite, symbolizing the system’s support for open-ended learning, continuous generalization, and limitless possibilities in intelligence development.

## What's NEW!
- [2025/08] RLinf v0.1 is released! The technical report [RLinf: Reinforcement Learning Infrastructure for Agentic AI](TODO:) is also released accordingly.


## Key Features


**RLinf is unique with:**

- Embodied Agent Support
- Fast adaptation support for mainstream VLA models: [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla), [OpenVLA-OFT](https://github.com/moojink/openvla-oft), and [π₀](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi).
- Support for mainstream CPU & GPU-based simulators via standardized RL interfaces: [ManiSkill3](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill), [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO).
- Enabling the first RL fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model family with a flow-matching action expert.

**RLinf is fast with:**

- Automatic online-scaling mechanism: GPU switching within 1 second.
- Auto-scheduling Strategy: automatically selects the most suitable execution mode based on the training workload.
- Improves efficiency by 20-40% while preserving the on-policy property of RL algorithms.

**RLinf is flexible and easy to use with:**

- Flexible Execution Modes

  - Collocated mode: shares all GPUs across all workers.
  - Disaggregated mode: enables fine-grained pipelining.
  - Hybrid mode: combines collocated and disaggregated modes—specially designed for agent training in embodied intelligence.

- Multiple Backend Integrations

  - A single unified interface drives two complementary backends, allowing seamless switching without code changes.
  - FSDP + Hugging Face: rapid adaptation to new models and algorithms, ideal for beginners and fast prototyping.
  - Megatron + SGLang: optimized for large-scale training, delivering maximum efficiency for expert users with demanding workloads.

- Built-in support for popular RL methods, including PPO, GRPO, DAPO, Reinforce++, and more.

- Support for SFT.
