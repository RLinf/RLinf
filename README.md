  <sub>RLinf: Reinforcement Learning Infrastructure for Agentic AI</sub>
</h1>

RLinf is a flexible and scalable open-source infrastructure designed for post-training foundation models via reinforcement learning. The 'inf' in RLinf stands for `Infrastructure`, highlighting its role as a robust backbone for next-generation training. It also stands for `Infinite`, symbolizing the system’s support for open-ended learning, continuous generalization, and limitless possibilities in intelligence development.

## What's NEW!
- [2025/08] RLinf is open-sourced. The formal v0.1 will be released soon. The paper [RLinf: Flexible and Efficient Large-scale Reinforcement Learning via Macro-to-Micro Flow Transformation]() will also be released accordingly. 

## Key Features


**RLinf is unique with:**
- Macro-to-Micro Flow: a new paradigm M2Flow, which executes macro-level logical flows through micro-level execution flows, decoupling logical workflow construction (programmable) from physical communication and scheduling (efficiency).

- Flexible Execution Modes

  - Collocated mode: shares all GPUs across all workers.
  - Disaggregated mode: enables fine-grained pipelining.
  - Hybrid mode: a customizable combination of different placement modes, integrating both collocated and disaggregated modes.

- Auto-scheduling Strategy: automatically selects the most suitable execution mode based on the training workload, without the need for manual resource allocation.
  
- Embodied Agent Support
  - Fast adaptation support for mainstream VLA models: [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla), [OpenVLA-OFT](https://github.com/moojink/openvla-oft), and [π₀](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi).
  - Support for mainstream CPU & GPU-based simulators via standardized RL interfaces: [ManiSkill3](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill), [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO).
  - Enabling the first RL fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model family with a flow-matching action expert.

**RLinf is fast with:**

- Hybrid mode with fine-grained pipelining: achieves a **120%+** throughput improvement compared to other frameworks.
- Automatic Online Scaling Strategy: dynamically scales training resources, with GPU switching completed within seconds, further improving efficiency by 20–40% while preserving the on-policy nature of RL algorithms.

**RLinf is flexible and easy to use with:**

- Multiple Backend Integrations

  - FSDP + Hugging Face: rapid adaptation to new models and algorithms, ideal for beginners and fast prototyping.
  - Megatron + SGLang: optimized for large-scale training, delivering maximum efficiency for expert users with demanding workloads.

- Adaptive communication via the asynchronous communication channel

- Built-in support for popular RL methods, including [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347), [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300), [DAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476), [Reinforce++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262), and more.
