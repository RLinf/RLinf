Automatic Scheduling
=====================

This chapter introduces how automatic scheduling is implemented in RLinf.  
It explains both the design philosophy and the practical configuration required to make it work.

- :doc:`online-scaling`  
   Provides an overview of the mechanism, focusing on the design principles behind RLinfâ€™s adaptive scaling capabilities.

- :doc:`dynamic-scheduling`  
   Details the concrete implementation of dynamic scheduling in RLinf,  
   including how to configure it properly to enable dynamic scheduling.

- :doc:`auto-placement`  
   Details the concrete implementation of auto-placement in RLinf,  
   including how to configure it properly to enable auto-placement.
