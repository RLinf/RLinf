Quickstart
==========

Welcome to the RLinf Quickstart Guide. This section will walk you through launching RLinf for the first time. 
We present three concise examples to demonstrate the framework's workflow and help you get started quickly.

Available examples:

- Embodied training on the XXX task using the XXX algorithm (see :doc:`embody`)

- Mathematical training on the XXX dataset using the XXX algorithm (see :doc:`math`)

- Distributed Multi-node training on the XXX dataset using the XXX algorithm (see :doc:`distribute`)
