class Channel:
    """A FIFO queue-like channel for inter-worker communication.

    **Creation**: Channel can be created both inside and outside of worker contexts.
    The recommended practice is to create channels outside of worker contexts using `Channel.create()`, and then pass them into workers as needed.
    You can also create channels inside worker contexts or connect to existing channels, using `self.create_channel()` or `self.connect_channel()`.

    **Interface**: Similar as the `asyncio.Queue`, the `Channel` provides interfaces like `put`, `get`, `put_no_wait`, and `get_no_wait`,
    as well as query interfaces like `qsize`, `empty`, and `full`.
    The semantics of these interfaces are identical to those of `asyncio.Queue`.

    **Features**:

    1. **Async operation**: Channel supports both synchronous and asynchronous `put` and `get` operations, similar to Worker's `send` and `recv` APIs. Both operations accept arbitrary data item as long as it's serializable. The default behavior is synchronous, and async operations can be enabled by setting the `async_op` flag. This async can be used not only in asyncio context with `await channel.get(async_op=True).async_wait()`, but also in non-asyncio contexts by generating a communication handle that can be waited later, like async torch.distributed.send().

    2. **Key-based routing**: Channel allows specifying a `key` for each data item, which can be used to identify and route messages. For example, if you wish a specific data to be get and processed by a specific worker, you can assign a unique key to that data item when putting it into the channel. The target worker can then use this key to retrieve the specific data item.This is useful in multi-turn scenarios in agent and embodied RL, where a data is processed by a fixed set of workers.

    3. **Weight and batch processing**: Channel also supports assigning weights to individual data items, allowing for more fine-grained control over how messages are processed. A `get_batch` method can be used to retrieve a batch of messages which respects the assigned weights.

    4. **Debugging**: Channel allows you to print a Channel's internal data by directly print the Channel object.
